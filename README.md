This is the Challenge 11 related to Express.js

## Description
This project, Note-Taker, is a full-stack application that provides a seamless interface for users to manage their notes. It leverages Express.js on the backend to handle HTTP requests for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting notes. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, interacts with the backend through these requests, providing a user-friendly way to manage notes. This project serves as a practical example of how frontend and backend can work together in a cohesive application. Developers can use tools like Postman to test each endpoint and ensure they are working as expected.

## Installation

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the `Usage` steps described below.
  
## Usage

The usage of this application is to provide a user-friendly interface for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting notes. This application serves as a practical example of a full-stack project, demonstrating the connection between frontend and backend operations. It's an excellent tool for users who need a simple and effective way to manage their notes, and a valuable resource for developers looking to understand how frontend and backend can work together in a cohesive application.

This is a step-by-step guide on how to use this application:
1. **Install the application:** Clone or download the application to your local machine. Then, navigate to the application directory in your terminal and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies, including Express.js and the uuid library for generating unique identifiers for notes.
  > npm install
  > npm install uuid

1. **Run the application:** In the terminal, run the command **node server.js** to start the application. This will start the server on your local machine.
   > node server.js

2. **Answer the prompts:** The application will prompt you with a series of questions about specific details for the logo, such as the color, shape, and any text they want to include.

3. **Access the application:** Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5501  
   You should see the Note-Taker application.

4. **Add a new note:** Click on the 'New Note' button, enter the title and text for your note, then click on the 'Save' button. Your note will be saved and displayed in the list of notes.
   
5. **Delete a note:** Click on the 'Delete' button next to a note to delete it. The note will be removed from the list.
   
6. **Update a note:** To update a note, you'll need to use a tool like Postman.(refer to helpers postman_collection). Send a PUT request to http://localhost:5501/api/notes/:id, replacing :id with the ID of the note you want to update. Include the updated title and text in the request body.
   
7. **Test the endpoints:** You can also use Postman to test the other endpoints of the application. For example, you can send a GET request to http://localhost:5501/api/notes to retrieve all notes, or a DELETE request to http://localhost:5501/api/notes/:id to delete a note.

## Features

+ **Interactive prompts:** The application uses the inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of questions about their requirements for the logo. The questions cover the color, shape, and any text they want to include in it.
+ **Customizable Shapes:** The application could allow users to choose from a variety of shapes for their logo, such as circles, squares, triangles, or even more complex shapes.
+ **Text Options:** Users could have the ability to customize the font, size, and placement of the text in their logo.
+ **Color Picker:** Instead of manually entering color values, the application could provide a color picker for users to choose their desired colors.
+ **Scalability:** The SVG logos generated by the application can be scaled to any size without loss of quality, making them suitable for a wide range of uses.
+ **Ease of Use:** The application's command-line interface is user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to create a custom logo.

## Contributing

Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Tests

The tests in this project verify the functionality of the SVG logo generator for different shapes: Triangle, Circle, and Square. Each shape has a corresponding test suite that checks the `render` method of the shape's class.

In each test suite, an instance of the shape class is created with specific parameters for text, text color, shape color, and border color. The `render` method is then called on this instance to generate an SVG string.

The tests check that the generated SVG string contains the correct elements and attributes for the specific shape, with the correct colors and text as provided in the parameters. This ensures that the `render` method is correctly generating the SVG for each shape based on the user's input.

These tests help ensure that the SVG logo generator is working as expected and producing the correct output for each shape.

***Thanks for stopping!***

In this challenge, you will work with a group to add routes to an existing application. You will create one wildcard route for serving up a 404 page, as well as a diagnostics route for logging failed form validation.

* As a developer, I want to be able to add routes to an existing application.

* As a developer, I want to serve up a custom 404 page when the requested resource doesn't exist.

* As a developer, I want to log usage statistics from users of my site.

* As a developer, I want to be able to deploy my apps to Heroku.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a wildcard route in `server.js` that will send the users to a 404 page.

* It's done when I have created a custom `404.html` page for my wildcard route to serve. 

* It's done when I have created a POST route for `/api/diagnostics` that will store information about the invalid form submissions.

* It's done when I have created a GET route for `/api/diagnostics` that will return the content of `db/diagnostics/json`.

* It's done when I have created a `fetch()` request on the front end that will send a POST request to `/api/diagnostics` every time a user attempts to submit an invalid form.

* It's done when I have tested my `/api/diagnostics` endpoint using Insomnia.

* It's done when I have tested the wildcard route by visiting any non-existent path, like `http://localhost/test`.

* It's done when I have deployed the finished application to Heroku.

## üí° Hints

How can we declare a wildcard route in Express.js?

How will `fs.writeFile()` help us log usage stats?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How else could we implement statistics logging without making a request from the front end?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
